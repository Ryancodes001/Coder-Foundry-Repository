                <p>I have been a world traveler, writer, a board gamer, and now I code. I have been blessed with a family that loves me and desire to learn. 
                In my spare time, I enjoy trying, like many nowadays, to Catch them All.  </p>

                <p>
                    My coding career began over a plate of pasta and cheesy breaksticks. Two good friends and I had decided that the best way to proceed in this life was to build things from our
                    couches. I had not shown much in the way of technical inclination before, so I was hesitant to pursue a career in coding. My interests had always been in strategy games and Lego construction, and
                    working through logic puzzles. What was I going to do sitting at a computer?
                </p>

                <h3>I was going to have a lot of fun</h3>

                <p>I began my journey, like many do, with simply Googling free resources. And then I was buried in resources. The web was so very congested with suggestions and guidelines for "learing to code quick!" or "Make 100k after only 12 weeks of training!" Needless to say, I was not convinced.</p>
